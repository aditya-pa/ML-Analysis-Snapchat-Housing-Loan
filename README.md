## Project Overview
This project analyzes three datasetsâ€”loan repayment, Mumbai housing prices, and Snapchat reviewsâ€”using machine learning. The goal is to classify sentiments, predict housing prices, and analyze loan repayment factors.

## Datasets Used
1. **Loan Payment Dataset**  
   - **Entries:** 396,030  
   - **Features:** 13 (Interest rate, installment, homeownership, verification status, bankruptcy status, etc.)  
   - **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM

2. **Mumbai Housing Price Dataset**  
   - **Entries:** 71,938  
   - **Features:** 15 (City, house type, bedrooms, bathrooms, balcony, furnishing, age, etc.)  
   - **Models Used:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, SVR

3. **Snapchat Reviews Dataset**  
   - **Entries:** 129,462  
   - **Features:** 8 (Username, review content, score, thumbs up count, review time, etc.)  
   - **Objective:** Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing (Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Encoding)
- Model selection and evaluation using multiple metrics
- Insights into finance, real estate, and text analytics

## Technologies Used
- **Programming:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, GitHub

## Results & Conclusion
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in finance, real estate, and sentiment analysis, providing actionable insights.
